<p>Hey! My name's Kevin Gimbel. I craft websites because I love the Internet.</p>
<p>I managed to learn quite a lot about HTML and CSS in the last few years and at the moment I'm learning more about programming - both Server and Client side, mostly JavaScript (Node.js) and PHP (because I have to).</p>
<p>By day I work at <a href="http://synoa.de" title="synoa.de">Synoa</a> as a Front-End Developer and by night I share useless but fun projects with the <a href="http://bullg.it">Bullgit</a> Team, release snippets of code on <a href="http://codepen.io/kevingimbel">CodePen</a> or watch good shows and movies.
I also try to write at least once a month about web stuff on this website.</p>

<p>For some super-interesting information on my work and school history there's a <a href="/cv/">CV Page</a>.</p>

### Projects

#### JekyllSnippets
I love Jekyll and because of this I started [JekyllSnippets.com](http://jekyllsnippets.com) a blog about all things related to Jekyll - links, Snippets, tutorials - you name it. Feel free to take a look or contribute. It's open-source, non-profit and free-everything. Enjoy!

#### bullg.it
After we at [bullg.it](http://bullg.it/) had a static page for about half and year we decided to build a new, flexible one based on Jekyll. I also used the GitHub API to fetch our Repos and Gravatar to fetch the Avatars for every member. [See the Repo](https://github.com/bullgit/bullgit.github.io)

### Fun Projects

#### Bulllog
Turn your `console.log()`s into super-fancy, CSS styled log messages! You can apply as many styles as you want (though
not all will be applied because the console is limited)! You can find the code on
[github.com](https://github.com/bullgit/Bulllog) or a Demo at [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/LxdGE).

#### Dull.js
On my way to learn more JavaScript I made a small Function called dull.js that prints a phrase a bunch of times on a page. [Take a look here](http://bullg.it/dull-js/)

#### github.js
While I build the new bullg.it website I also wrote a Ajax wrapper for the GitHub API called [github.js](http://kevingimbel.com/demo/github-js/). It takes a few arguments as well as a HTML template that is used to display a list of repositories later.
