Hey! My name's Kevin Gimbel. I build thing for the internet and love Open Source. 

I build and share useless but fun projects with the [bullgit](http://bullgit.github.io) Team, talk about nerd and web stuff on [tlk.io](http://tlk.io/codepen) or realease snippets of code on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel) - they're all free to use everywhere.

I also try to write at least once a month about web stuff on this website.

For some super-interesting information on my work and school history there's a [CV Page](/cv/).

### Open Source

Because I love Open Source I do also love to contribute to it if I can. I helped to improve [opentalk.me](http://opentalk.me) with my CSS knowledge. 
I also share free and re-usable code on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel) and [Github](http://github.com/kevingimbel).

Even the source code of this website is free and re-usable. In other words: You can fork the repo, rename stuff and re-publish it again only with a few limitations I pointed out in a [license](/license/).


### Projects

#### Readrr
Readrr has been a really long-term project I'm working on with [Tim](http://timpietrusky.com) and [Max](http://myxotod.de). It's developed in out spare time and there's the problem: We don't have much of it. Development is going slowly. Anyway you can sing-up at [readrr.li](http://readrr.li) or follow us on twitter [@readrr](http://twitter.com/readrr).

#### clickandco.de
clickandco.de is going to be a challenge system for CodePen. The basic idea is: You can create a Challenge with some HTML, CSS or JS Markup and people can take this challenge with one click on a button that redirects to a already pre-filled new CodePen.
