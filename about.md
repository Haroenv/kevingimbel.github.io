Hey! My name's Kevin Gimbel. I craft websites because I love the internet.
I managed to learn quite a lot about HTML and CSS in the last few years and at the moment I'm learning more about programming - both Server and Client side.

I work at [Synoa](http://synoa.de) as a Front-End Developer and I really like it. 

I build and share useless but fun projects with the [bullgit](http://bullg.it) Team, realease snippets of code on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel) or [push to master](http://github.com/kevingimbel).
I also try to write at least once a month about web stuff on this website.

For some super-interesting information on my work and school history there's a [CV Page](/cv/).


## Projects
### JekyllSnippets
I love Jekyll and because of this I started [JekyllSnippets.com](http://jekyllsnippets.com) a blog about all things related to Jekyll - links, Snippets, tutorials - you name it. Feel free to take a look or contribute. It's open-source, non-profit and free-everything. Enjoy!

### bullg.it
After we at [bullg.it](http://bullg.it/) had a static page for about half and year we decided to build a new, flexible one based on Jekyll. I also used the GitHub API to fetch our Repos and Gravatar to fetch the Avatars for every member. [See the Repo](https://github.com/bullgit/bullgit.github.io)

## Fun Projects

### Dull.js
On my way to learn more JavaScript I made a small Function called dull.js that prints a phrase a bunch of times on a page. [Take a look here](http://bullg.it/dull-js/)

### github.js
While I build the new bullg.it website I also wrote a Ajax wrapper for the GitHub API called [github.js](http://kevingimbel.com/demo/github-js/). It takes a few arguments as well as a HTML template that is used to display a list of repositories later.
