<p>Hey! My name's Kevin Gimbel. I create websites and enjoy a good tea.</p>
<p>I specialized on Front-End Development, especially HTML and (S)CSS with Gulp and Libsass over the last few years. By
day I work at <a href="http://www.synoa.de">Synoa</a>, my main responsibility is the accassability of our clients
websites on all possible devices - from small phones to big TVs, watches, eReaders - you name it.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy some good games, especially the Fallout series, the Assassin's Creed Series, Skate and
sometimes strategy games such as Banished or Anno (1602-1701).</p>

<p>I'm a proud member of the <a href="http://bullg.it">bullgit</a> team, an international team of developers from all
over the world, ranging from India to America - we're here to serve the finest of uselessness.</p>

<p>For some super-interesting information on my work and school history there's a <a href="/cv/">CV Page</a>.</p>
