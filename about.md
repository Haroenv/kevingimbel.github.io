![Hey, that's me.](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d391d8c3a528122f3f6c991821350ac?s=200)

Hey! My name's Kevin Gimbel. I create websites and enjoy a good tea.

I specialized on Front-End Development, especially HTML and (S)CSS with Gulp and Libsass over the last few years. By
day I work at [Synoa](http://synoa.de), my main responsibility is the accessibility of our clients
websites on all possible devices - from small phones to big TVs, watches, eReaders - you name it.

In my free time I enjoy some good games, especially the Fallout series, the Assassin's Creed Series, Skate and
sometimes strategy games such as Banished or Anno (1602-1701).

I'm a proud member of the [bullgit](http://bullg.it) team, an international team of developers from all
over the world, ranging from India to America - we're here to serve the finest of uselessness.

For some super-interesting information on my work and school history there's a [CV](/cv/) Page.

Below you can find some more personal blog posts that I've written.
