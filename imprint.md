#### Technology

This site is build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), [Nick Quaranto](http://quaran.to/) and many more [awesome contributors](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/graphs/contributors).

This page is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/kevingimbel/kevingimbel.github.io), the source code is free to see and free to use as long as you mention and link back to this site. The Design is highly inspired by [Medium](http://medium.com) and therefor this Template is called "The Medium", the code (CSS, HTML) is written by myself.

I'm using:

- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) to build this page and write new posts
- [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) as my main Operating System
- [Github](http://github.com) to host the main page
- [Uberspace](http://uberspace.de) to host files
