Below you can find some of the private projects I've been working on. Some more
can be found at the [Synoa GmbH references page](http://synoa.de/referenzen "See the Synoa GmbH references page") &mdash; at some
point I was involved in any of these projects with Front-End Development.

### Websites

#### regex.wtf
I've found Regular Expressions to be very useful in my day-to-day life, either when searching
through files or to strip things in PHP or JavaScript. I launched [regex.wtf](http://regex.wtf "Visit regex.wtf") to
write down snippets and explanations whenever I find a new thing - this hopefully helps me to
memorize them better!

#### bullg.it
After we at [bullg.it](https://bullg.it/ "See the bullgit Website") had a static page for about half and year we decided to build a new, flexible one based on Jekyll. I also used the GitHub API to fetch our Repos and Gravatar to fetch the Avatars for every member. [See the Repo](https://github.com/bullgit/bullgit.github.io "View the source code of the Bullgit Website")


### Other Projects

#### viewSwitcher.js
[viewSwitcher.js](https://github.com/kevingimbel/viewSwitcher "viewSwitcher.js on GitHub") was build to see how tab handling with JavaScript could work and then evolved into something "bigger". It's basically a Script that handles URL hashes and activates different parts of a website based on what URL(-hash) is active at the moment.

You can find more [on the Project Page](http://kevingimbel.com/viewSwitcher/#home "See the viewSwitcher Project Site"), see it in use for my [bi-lingual CV](http://kevingimbel.com/viewSwitcher/examples/cv/#en "Take a look at the bi-lingual CV") or just view the basic [Full Page Example](http://kevingimbel.com/viewSwitcher/examples/fullpage/ "See a Full-Page example"). viewSwitcher is more or less actively developed.

#### github.js
While I build the new [bullgit website](https://bullg.it "Visit the Bullgit website") I also wrote a Ajax wrapper for the GitHub API called [github.js](http://kevingimbel.com/demo/github-js/ "See github.js on GitHub"). It takes a few arguments as well as a HTML template that is used to display a list of repositories later.

#### minute-to-hour
[minute-to-hour](http://kevingimbel.com/minute-to-hour/ "See Minute-to-Hour in action") is a very basic Minute-to-hour converter I build to get to know ReactJS. It's fully open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/kevingimbel/minute-to-hour "View the  Minute-to-Hour source code on GitHub") and I use it quite a lot.

#### vhost
[vhost](https://github.com/kevingimbel/vhost "See vhost in GitHub") is a command line utility for creating new Virtual Hosts for the Apache Server. It was build out of laziness. Since I'm working with Apache every day and need to create new Virtual Hosts every now and then I decided it's time to automate the process so I build this bash script.


### Fun Stuff and Experiments

#### AVH.js
AdjustViewportHeight.js is a small script that makes the `vh` unit available in browsers that don't support it. It's not
ready for production and will most likely not be developed any further. However,
this was my first dive into basic feature detection using JavaScript. [Here's a live
demo](http://dev.kevingimbel.me/adjust-viewport-height/ "See the AVH Demo")

#### Bulllog
Turn your `console.log()`s into super-fancy, CSS styled log messages! You can apply as many styles as you want (though
not all will be applied because the console is limited)! You can find the code on
[github.com](https://github.com/bullgit/Bulllog "See Bulllog on GitHub") or a Demo at [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/LxdGE "See the Bulllog Demo on CodePen").

#### Dull.JS
On my way to learn more JavaScript I made a small Function called Dull.JS that prints a phrase a bunch of times on a page. [Take a look here](http://bullg.it/dull-js/ "See Dull.JS in action")
