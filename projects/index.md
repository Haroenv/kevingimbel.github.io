Below you can find some of the private projects I've been working on. Some more
can be found at the <a
href="http://synoa.de/referenzen">Synoa GmbH references page</a> &mdash; at some
point I was involved in any of these projects.

#### JekyllSnippets
I love Jekyll and because of this I started [JekyllSnippets.com](http://jekyllsnippets.com) a blog about all things related to Jekyll - links, Snippets, tutorials - you name it. Feel free to take a look or contribute. It's open-source, non-profit and free-everything. Enjoy!

#### bullg.it
After we at [bullg.it](http://bullg.it/) had a static page for about half and year we decided to build a new, flexible one based on Jekyll. I also used the GitHub API to fetch our Repos and Gravatar to fetch the Avatars for every member. [See the Repo](https://github.com/bullgit/bullgit.github.io)

### Other Projects

#### AVH.js
AdjustViewportHeight.js is a small script that makes the `vh` unit available in browsers that don't support it. It's not
ready for production and will most likely not be developed any further. However,
this was my first dive into basic feature detection using JavaScript. [Here's a live
demo](http://dev.kevingimbel.me/adjust-viewport-height/)

#### TARDIS.js
TARDIS.js (Time and Relative Dates in Scripts; A direct Doctor Who reference) is a script to work with dates that I made
out of the curiousity how Date manipulation with JavaScript works. There's a [demo on my dev
site](http://dev.kevingimbel.me/TARDIS/).

#### Bulllog
Turn your `console.log()`s into super-fancy, CSS styled log messages! You can apply as many styles as you want (though
not all will be applied because the console is limited)! You can find the code on
[github.com](https://github.com/bullgit/Bulllog) or a Demo at [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/LxdGE).

#### Dull.js
On my way to learn more JavaScript I made a small Function called dull.js that prints a phrase a bunch of times on a page. [Take a look here](http://bullg.it/dull-js/)

#### github.js
While I build the new bullg.it website I also wrote a Ajax wrapper for the GitHub API called [github.js](http://kevingimbel.com/demo/github-js/). It takes a few arguments as well as a HTML template that is used to display a list of repositories later.
